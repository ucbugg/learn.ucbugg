<h1 id="advanced_rigging">Advanced Rigging</h1>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>Today we are going to be rigging a bipedal character. After this tutorial, you should be able to apply these basic concepts to many different characters of various shape and form. The bipedal character we'll be using is <a href="../images/advanced-rigging/blobber.ma">blobber</a>(he's a bit blobby). Download him from the link and make sure to place him in your <strong>UCBUGG Lab</strong>(or equivalent) project.</p>
<p>Now open up Maya, set your project to <strong>UCBUGG Lab</strong>, open up blobber from your scenes directory... you know the drill.</p>
<p>Let's get started on rigging!</p>
<p>If you just said "Wait, don't I have to freeze transform and delete history from a model before I rig?", I must say, you have learnt well. Usually when a modeler hands off a model to a rigger those things will all be taken care of. But, to make a point<s>make your lives miserable</s> I intentionally left that out. So make sure you apply <strong>Modify-&gt;Freeze Transformations</strong> and <strong>Edit-&gt;Delete All by Type-&gt;History</strong> on the model. Also if there are any leftover transformation histories delete them as well. If you don't remember what these are, refer to the <a href="http://learn.ucbugg.com/basic-rigging">Basic Rigging</a> lab.</p>
<p>Your outliner should end up looking like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Clean up" src="../images/advanced-rigging/000_cleanup.png" /></p>
<h2 id="camera_view">Camera view</h2>
<p><strong>This section is an optional section to help with your workflow. You don't have to do it.</strong></p>
<p>Remember the four-view and single-view mode we alwyas worked on? Well, surprise! Maya lets you customize this to a great degree.</p>
<p>For rigging, I personally like to be in the two panes arrangement with front and side views. (In general you want to be working in the orthographic views for rigging.)</p>
<p>To do this, go to <strong>Window-&gt;View Arrangements-&gt;Two Panes Side by Side</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="Two Panes Side by Side" src="../images/advanced-rigging/001_twopanes.png" /></p>
<p>now that you have a split-screen arrangement. Let's go to the panels menu and change the panels to <em>front</em> and <em>side</em>.</p>
<p><img alt="Orthographic-&gt;Front" src="../images/advanced-rigging/001_pbs.png" /></p>
<p>You should end up with a view like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Front by Side" src="../images/advanced-rigging/001_fbs.png" /></p>
<p>This is just a workflow tip and is not essential to rigging (also depends on your personal preference), but hey, you learnt something new about Maya's User Interface today!</p>
<h2 id="rigging_the_legs">Rigging the Legs</h2>
<p>Okay. Finally to rigging. So this is a very similar process to the lamp model we did last week. If you feel like I'm going a little fast, make sure you fully understand the <a href="http://learn.ucbugg.com/basic-rigging">basic rigging lab</a>.</p>
<p>Just so we can see the joints we're placing, make sure X-Ray Joints are on. If your joints are coming out too small, increase the radius of that joint in the channel box.</p>
<p><img alt="X-Ray and Radius" src="../images/advanced-rigging/002_visualization.png" /></p>
<p>So the most important joint, is the one we start with. You would put this on the pelvis of a bipedal character, and name it <strong>Center Of Gravity</strong> or <strong>cog</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="cog" src="../images/advanced-rigging/003_cog.png" />
<em>Check both the front and side views as to make sure that it's around the pelvis.</em></p>
<p>From there, we're now going to stem the leg. Place joints on <strong>the hip, knee, ankle, ball of the foot, and then an extra one right outside the toes</strong> like the following picture.</p>
<p><img alt="Left Leg" src="../images/advanced-rigging/004_leftLeg.png" /></p>
<p>If you've noticed, whenever you move a joint, all the joints down the hierarchy move as well. If you want to avoid this, hold <strong>d</strong> and move the joint. Remember how you can move the pivot of any object by holding <strong>d</strong>? Well, a joint is its pivot, and that's why this works! Logical, eh?</p>
<p>Make sure you see both views and the joints are where the rotation pivot should be. Try moving and kicking your leg and see if you can figure out where your bones pivot around.</p>
<p>If you're thinking "Oh gosh I should name these.", I am so proud of you! Let's go to the outliner and name them. This is just how I named them:</p>
<p><img alt="Names" src="../images/advanced-rigging/005_naming.png" /></p>
<p>So we have one leg rigged... great. We could repeat this for the other leg, but that would be tideous right? Maya gives us a great tool called <strong>Skeleton-&gt;Mirror Joints</strong> that you can use. Select your <em>LHipJnt</em>(And just your <em>LHipJnt</em>), or your equivalent name. And select the option box for <strong>Skeleton-&gt;Mirror Joints</strong>. If you've named your joints consistently dpeending on which side of the body they're in, you can also make Maya rename your joints to the other side too!(<em>R-&gt;L</em> or <em>Right-&gt;Left</em> or vice-versa) Finally, make sure you select <strong>Orientation</strong> as the mirror function instead of <strong>Behavior</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="Mirror Joints" src="../images/advanced-rigging/006_mirror.png" /></p>
<p>Hit mirror, and voila! Aren't computers great?</p>
<h2 id="rigging_the_upper_body">Rigging the Upper Body</h2>
<p>Now we're moving on to the spine.
Lets get started without delay.</p>
<p><img alt="Spine Joints" src="../images/advanced-rigging/007_spine.png" /></p>
<p>This is how I put my spine joints: 3 spine joints But again, try figuring out where you feel your spine has the biggest movements your character must have. Also think about what your spine actually looks like, as we're trying to emulate a human skeleton/muscle system.</p>
<p>If you're wondering how you can continue to append newly created joint hierarchies, remember that joints are all in a parent child relationship! So just <strong>MMB-Drag</strong> your child joint into the parent joint and the connection will be automatically created! (e.g. Spine1 into Cog)</p>
<p>For the arms, I recommend a clavicle, shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingerbase, and fingertip (If you want you can add rigs for the thumbs too). Just as we did for the legs, lets mirror joints with the same options (Make sure they are the same options as above.), and we have the upper body pretty much done!</p>
<p><img alt="Arm Joints" src="../images/advanced-rigging/008_leftArm.png" /></p>
<p>My character has an extremely simple head, and barely a face so we're going to create a simple rig to match.</p>
<p><img alt="Head Joints" src="../images/advanced-rigging/009_head.png" /></p>
<h2 id="some_cleanup_and_testing">Some Cleanup and Testing</h2>
<p>Remember the cleanup work we did after rigging the lamp? Well, it's that time again!</p>
<p>Regarding joints, using <strong>Orient Joints</strong> to properly set the rotation axis is usually all you need so that's done. Easy! Check back with the <a href="http://learn.ucbugg.com/basic-rigging#orient_joints">basic rigging lab</a> to see how to use this tool.</p>
<p>Now let's do some real testing with the rig.</p>
<p>If you select your CogJnt(which selects the whole joint hierarchy) and your bodyMesh, and then use <strong>Skin-&gt;Bind Skin</strong>. This will now bind your skeleton to your mesh! Test it out by rotating the joints.</p>
<p><img alt="Smooth Bind" src="../images/advanced-rigging/010_smooth_bind.png" /></p>
<p>Yay! We have a basic bipedal rig working!</p>
<p>For the head, lets just use the simple and trustworthy parent constraint. Select the somewhat awkward <strong>HeadJnt</strong> on the top and then your <strong>headMesh</strong>, and just parent constraint them, just like how we did in the previous lab. Now when you rotate <strong>neck2</strong>, you should have the head moving. YAY!</p>
<p>But we're not done yet. We can still add more functionalities and also controllers.
Undo the movement and let's add IK Handles!</p>
<h2 id="ik_handles">IK Handles</h2>
<p>Remember IKs? They made certain actions like making the base fold easier when controlling the lamp right? We're going to do a very similar thing with this character as well.</p>
<p>So select your <strong>Skeleton-&gt;IK Handle Tool</strong> and click your <em>LHipJnt</em> And <em>LAnkleJnt</em>. Name the <em>IKHandle1</em> as <em>LFootIK</em> and also, if you can find it(think/remember where it would be!), name <em>effector1</em> to <em>LFootIKEffector</em>.</p>
<p>Now lets repeat this for the right foot, the left hand, and the right hand. All in all it should look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="IK" src="../images/advanced-rigging/011_IK.png" /></p>
<h2 id="controllers">Controllers</h2>
<p>We've visited controllers last week in basic rigging, and we're pretty much going to follow the same steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a <em>NURBS circle</em>.</li>
<li>Name it <em>LFootCtrl</em>, or the equivalent name for the IK you're controlling.</li>
<li>IMPORTANT: <strong>Freeze Transform</strong> it.</li>
<li>Parent the IK Handle to the Controller. </li>
<li>Repeat for all IK Handles.</li>
</ul>
<p>That gives us the basic controllers for the IK!
Play around with it and see it work.</p>
<p><img alt="Basic Controls" src="../images/advanced-rigging/012_IKControllers.png" /></p>
<p>Now remember to control the joint at the same time, we also need to orient constraint the joint to the controller. So let's do that!</p>
<ul>
<li>IMPORTANT: Bring your controller back to it's default position. If you remembered to Freeze Transform it, this is simple as putting all your controllers attributes in the channel box to 0.</li>
<li>Select your controller. <em>LFootCtrl</em></li>
<li>Select your joint. <em>LAnkleJnt</em></li>
<li>Use <strong>Constraints-&gt;Orient</strong> (Make sure maintain offset is checked in the option box!</li>
<li>Repeat for all Controllers.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might think this part is a bit tedious, and unfortunately, rigging is like that unless you are familiar with scripting and are willing to set up an automated system. At least our biped only has four limbs! Imagine if you were rigging an alien with 8 arms!</p>
<p>Bear with me for just one more controller now: The Head.</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a NURBS Circle and name it <strong>HeadCtrl</strong>.</li>
<li>Put it around the head like halo.</li>
<li>Then move the <strong>HeadCtrl</strong>'s pivot down to where the <strong>neck2</strong> joint is located.</li>
<li>Make sure you Freeze Transformation!</li>
<li>Select the <strong>HeadCtrl</strong>, then the <strong>neck2</strong> joint, and orient constraint!</li>
</ul>
<p>As the head is only driven by a joint (you're free to add an IK here as well! Though not as useful as on the hands and legs, you can use it ), you only need an orient constraint for the <strong>HeadCtrl</strong>.</p>
<p>At this point, I want to introduce one more constraint: the <strong>Pole Vector</strong> Constraint. This constraint is extremely useful for knees and elbows (which we can't currently control with IK as manually as we want).</p>
<p>Oh, before we do this, there's one special thing you need to do with your IK handles. With the IK Handle selected, go to your attribute editor and change the <strong>IK Solver</strong> to <strong>ikRPsolver</strong>. Make sure you do this for all four of your IK Handles. This must be done for your IK handles to accept input from pole vector constraints. If this makes your arm twise weirdly, don't worry as the next step should fix this.</p>
<p><img alt="Locator" src="../images/advanced-rigging/013_IKsolver.png" /></p>
<p>Let's drive this constraint with a <strong>Locator</strong>. This can be found under <strong>Create-&gt;Locator</strong>. A Locator is just a nil object that denotes a position. You should get a 3d crosshair. Now lets move this crosshair to the knee joint. If you hold <strong>v</strong> as you move your locator, you should be able to snap it easily to the exact position of the knee. Now just bring it forward right about here:</p>
<p><img alt="Locator" src="../images/advanced-rigging/014_Locator.png" />
 (You should put it far enough that your knee can never touch it)</p>
<p>What is that? We should Freeze Transform this locator? You're right! Let's do that right now.</p>
<p>Now to apply the constraint, select the locator and rename it to <strong>LKneeCtrl</strong>, and then select <strong>LFootIK</strong> (Remember, it's the driver then the driven for constraints always.) You don't need anything from the option box of <em>Pole Vector</em> constraint so just click <strong>Constraints-&gt;Pole Vector</strong>.</p>
<p>Now when you move your <strong>LKneeCtrl</strong> around, your knee will try to aim at it. This is how you would obtain finer controls for your knee. I know it's tedious, but now you can repeat for your right knee, left elbow, and right elbow. (For the elbows, you would place the locators behind the elbows as that's the natural way they bend.) Don't forget to freeze transformations! I actually forgot to do this while writing this lab, and had to redo all of this... T_T Never make that mistake.</p>
<div class=note>
Tip: If you want to exactly match the position of the locator on just one axis(for example, the RKneeCtrl should match LKneeCtrl's X position), then you can hold v, just like how you snapped to the joint, but only move the arrow pointing in the axis you want, and it will try to snap only to those axis positions of the locators or vertices that are around. If you hide the mesh and the rig while doing this it might be easier.
</div>

<p>All in all, it should look like this in the end:</p>
<p><img alt="PoleVector" src="../images/advanced-rigging/015_polevector.png" /></p>
<p>Now the knee actually moves as the foot IK moves. Therefore make sure you parent constraint the two (<em>FootCtrl</em> should drive the <em>KneeCtrl</em>. Remember that for constraints, you select the driver then the driven.). Do the same for your <em>HandCtrl</em> into <em>ElbowCtrl</em>.</p>
<p>Phew. That was a lot of new things learnt and done huh? Well, we're now nearing the end!</p>
<h2 id="master_controller_and_cleanup">Master Controller and Cleanup</h2>
<p>Remember the Master Controller from last lab? Well this is now the last step! </p>
<p>This is the last NURBS Circle we will create for this lab. Make it big enough on the ground so that it encapsulates the whole character and Freeze Transformation. Now parent all the controllers and the joints into the Master Controller.</p>
<p><img alt="Master" src="../images/advanced-rigging/016_master.png" /></p>
<p>Doesn't it look all pretty and controllable now? Good job!</p>
<p>Now you can repeat the standard hide joints and locking we saw last lab, and other various work to hide our messy work.</p>
<p>The next part of rigging, which isn't going to be explicitly covered in class time, is skinning. You can find our tutorial for skinning right here: <a href="http://learn.ucbugg.com/skinning">Skinning Lab</a>.</p>
<p>Skinning will fix issues such as the picture below where things don't deform the way you want them to.</p>
<p><img alt="SkinningError" src="../images/advanced-rigging/017_skinning.png" /></p>
<p>An awkward knee you've got there!?</p>
<p>If you're curious this is what I have at the end of the tutorial: <a href="../images/advanced-rigging/blobberRig.ma">Rigged Blobber</a></p>
<h2 id="extra_for_experts">Extra for Experts</h2>
<h3 id="spine_controllers">Spine Controllers</h3>
<p>Now you have a basic bipedal rig. One thing missing in our rig though is the spine control. Think about how you would rig the spine! It will be done with a mix of orient constraints between controllers and joints, and then parenting of those controllers.</p>
