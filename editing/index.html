  You are here: <a href="../">Home</a> &rarr; <a href="../editing">Editing</a>

<h1 id="editing_your_animation">Editing Your Animation</h1>
<p>We'll now turn your multiple image sequences into a finished animation. You should be excited.</p>
<h2 id="create_movie_files_from_image_sequences">Create Movie Files from Image Sequences</h2>
<p>We'll be using Quicktime Pro to turn image sequences into actual movie files. We create image sequences with <a href="../rendering">batch rendering</a> If you don't have an image sequence to use, go ahead and download our <a href="../images/editing/image-sequence.zip">sample image sequence</a>.</p>
<h3 id="opening_an_image_sequence">Opening an Image Sequence</h3>
<p>Open <strong>Quicktime Player 7</strong>, not just Quicktime Player. It's located in /Applications/Utilties/Quicktime Player 7. Go to File &rarr; Open Image Sequence... and locate the first (and only first) file in your image sequence and click "Open". </p>
<p><img alt="Open Image Sequence" src="../images/editing/open-image-seq.png" /></p>
<p>Select "24 frames per second".</p>
<p><img alt="Frame Rate" src="../images/editing/frame-rate.png" /></p>
<p>Go ahead and press play to watch your animation (it might be a bit slow).</p>
<h3 id="saving_your_scene">Saving your Scene</h3>
<p>Now it's time to save your scene as an actual file. Go to File &rarr; Export... and select "Movie to Quicktime Movie" from the <strong>Export</strong> dropdown menu.</p>
<p><img alt="Movie Export" src="../images/editing/export.png" /></p>
<p>Click on the "Options" button and make your settings match the image below. Compression, Quality, and Key Frame Rate are set by clicking on the "Settings..." button. The size should be 1280x720 if you are rendering in 720HD, or 1920x1080 if you are rendering in 1080HD. Click "OK" once you're done. </p>
<p><img alt="Settings" src="../images/editing/settings.png" /></p>
<p>Click "Save" to finish exporting your movie.</p>
<p>Now that all your scenes have been saved, we will edit them in iMovie.</p>
<h2 id="edit_with_imovie">Edit With iMovie</h2>
<p>Now that you have all your scenes in separate movie files, it's time to edit them together.</p>
<p>Before you start, you will need an <strong>external flash drive</strong>, preferably with at least 4gb of space. Make sure there is nothing important on the drive, as we will be reformating (<strong>erasing</strong>) the drive.</p>
<h3 id="reformat_your_flashdrive">Reformat Your Flashdrive</h3>
<p>First, plug your flashdrive into the computer and wait for it to mount. Open <strong>Disk Utility</strong>, found in /Applications/Utilities/Disk Utility</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the flashdrive on the left </li>
<li>Click the "Erase" button. </li>
<li>Select <strong>Mac OS Extended (Journaled)</strong> from the <strong>Format</strong> dropdown</li>
<li>Pick a name. </li>
<li>Click the "Erase..." button and then click "Erase" on the pop up</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="Disk Utility" src="../images/editing/disk-utility.png" /></p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You will not be able to read/write from this drive on a Windows computer. Consider yourself warned.</p>
<p>For the rest of the tutorial, the flashdrive will be named <strong>UCBUGG</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="setup_imovie">Setup iMovie</h3>
<p>Before we starting editing, we need to change a setting in iMovie. Open up Terminal, found in /Applicatoins/Utilities/Terminal, type</p>
<pre><code>defaults write -app iMovie allowNV -bool true
</code></pre>
<p>and hit return.</p>
<p>iMovie is now ready to be used.</p>
